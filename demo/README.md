Here is a very quick demo of a potential UI for automating devices. You will see a top row for functions that can be selected and a button row for what the user can configure by drag and drop.

Tasks:
- Improve the code to ensure that the user's drag-and-drop actions are stored and retained (either in an SQLite database or something similar).
- Add functionality to allow users to drill down on the selected card that may have parameters requiring configuration, such as setting a threshold value in a function or defining what sensor data is used for automation.

There is no right or wrong answers, if you require any additional infomation please reach out.
